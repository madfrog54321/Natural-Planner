# Natural-Planner
A goal/project tracking Android app

This app's idea came from David Allen's Natural Planning Model. This TEDx talk he gave explains the idea. http://tedx.amsterdam/2014/12/david-allen-getting-things-done-natural-planning/

The main goal of this app is to help users make a goal/project into a easy to follow to-do list, or "action list". The app needs to provide a easy to use interface for the user. The visual design is recommend to be inline with the Google Material Design guidelines.

These guidelines can be found here:

This design system will provide a coherent experience for the user.
